# Chef_Claude_Project

Chef_Claude-Project is an innovative web application where users can input gradients and connect to an AI to receive personalized recipes. This project demonstrates both front-end development with React and the integration of AI for dynamic content generation, deployed on GitHub Pages. I learned the skills for this project from the Scrimba platform.
